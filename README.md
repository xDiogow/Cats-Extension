# Cats-Extension
Just a image extension made in python.

### How it works?
We get all the pixels in the image, convert them to hex and save them to a file. The first line is used for the image dimension.

### Why you shouldn't use this technique ?
- Images in .cats files can be up to 150x times bigger than a png or even a jpeg file.

### What's the proper way of doing this?
- Using Binary will make the files a lot more lightweight

### Note:
I've added the files that I have used to test my program. Hope it helps you to test my project.

Thanks for reading!

### Inspiration 
I've made this project after seeing the video of FaceDev. I recommend you to watch it if you want to create your own image extension. [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48B8FPmMT0g)
